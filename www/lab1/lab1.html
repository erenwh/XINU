<h2>3. Inspecting XINU's run-time environment [115 pts]</h2>

<h3>Problem 3.1 (30 pts)</h3>

<p>
Follow the instructions in the
<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs354/xinu/xinu-setup.html">XINU set-up description</a>
which compiles the XINU source code on a frontend machine (Linux PC)
in the XINU Lab, grabs an unused x86 Galileo backend machine, and 
loads and bootstraps the compiled XINU image. Note that the frontend
PC's terminal acts as a (remote) console of the dedicated
backend Galileo x86 machine. If XINU bootstraps successfully,
it will print a greeting message and start a simple shell
called xsh. Run some commands on the shell and follow
the disconnect procedure so that the backend is released.
<b>Do not hold onto a backend: it is a shared resource.</b>
</p>

<p>
(a) Inside the system/ subdirectory, you will find relevant
source code of XINU. The file start.S contains assembly code
that is executed after XINU loads on a backend. After
performing bootstrap/initialization chores (the details are
not relevant at this time), a call to function nulluser()
is made. Locate where in system/ the source code of nulluser()
is defined. (b) Toward the end of nulluser(), it calls the
function create() -- a system call as discussed in class --
to create a new running program (i.e.,
process) whose code is the function main() contained in 
main.c. 
All processes in XINU are created using create() except the
process that runs the function nulluser() which is "self-made."
That is, it is the ancestor of all other processes.
Find out where in the XINU source code this ancestor of all processes
is located and what name, i.e., process ID (PID), it assigns itself. 
To do so, track down the header file (header files are located in 
the include/ directory) where the PID value of the ancestor process is
specified. 
(c) What does the ancestor process running
the function nulluser() do for the rest of its existence? 
(d) Does nulluser() ever return after being called by
the code in start.S? (e) halt() is called after nulluser() in start.S.
Where is the source code of halt() located and what does it do? 
(f) What happens if you remove this function
call from start.S? Does XINU run as before? (g) What happens if you replace the
while-loop at the end of nulluser() with a call to halt()? Discuss all
your findings.
</p>

<h3>Problem 3.2 (50 pts)</h3>

<p>
In Linux/UNIX, to create a new process that runs an
executable binary, say, /bin/ls (or a.out), we first use the system call fork() to create a child
process and then call the system call execve() with /bin/ls (or a.out) as an argument.
In XINU we said that a newly created process is put in a "state of limbo," i.e., suspended, after
it is created using create(). That is, the child process exists as an entry in the process table
but it is marked as suspended (PR_SUSP). The definition of all XINU process states is specified
in process.h under include/. Being in suspended state has the consequence that XINU will not assign CPU
cycles to the process until its state is changed to ready (PR_READY) by calling resume().
Look at the code of create() and resume() and determine how this is done.
</p>
<p>
(a) What happens in Linux after a new process is created using fork()? Note, create() specifies
what code to run as the child process through its first argument (a function pointer).
(b) Determine who runs first: parent or child. Try to empirically gauge the answer by running test code
on the frontend Linux PCs. (We will discuss scheduling of processes
in modern operating systems, a complex topic, when discussing process management.)
(c) As an app programmer, do you have a preference as to which process -- parent or child --
should run next in Linux? Explain your reasoning.
(d) For a child process created using fork() in Linux, it has to call execve() to make the
child run executable code contained in a file (e.g., /bin/ls) as part of a file system
specified in the argument of execve().
In Linux, sometimes an app programmer just wants to create a new
process to run an existing binary without going through the 2-step procedure of fork() and execve().
Write a wrapper function, int newProcess(const char *filename), that internally calls
fork() and execve() to make this happen where filename specifies the full pathname of an
executable binary. Place the code of newProcess() in newProcess.c under system/.
Annotate your code with comments to facilitate readability.
</p>
<p>
(e) How is newProcess() fundamentally different from the way XINU's create() works?
(f) Ignore stack size and process priority which are specified as arguments in create().
How does Linux's clone() compare to XINU's create()?
(g) How does Linux's posix_spawn() compared to your newProcess() implementation?
(h) Is there a best way to create processes? Explain your reasoning.
</p>

<h3>Problem 3.3 (5 pts)</h3>

<p>
Customize the welcome message printed by XINU in main() so that it 
prominently displays your name (last, first) and username. Preserve the new
welcome message as part of your version of XINU during the
rest of the semester and the labs to follow.
</p>

<h3>Problem 3.4 (30 pts)</h3>

<p>
Problems 3.1 and 3.2 looked at the overall picture and steps involved
in starting XINU and running apps under XINU. To get a sense of 
how to terminate processes and XINU itself, create a process that runs the
code of a function onandon() by calling create() with stack size 2048
and priority 30. onandon() should be an infinite loop that makes a
XINU system call putc(CONSOLE, 'x') followed by system call
sleep() with argument 2 within its loop. onandon() prints the character 'x',
sleeps for 2 seconds, repeating this forever. The process running
the function main(), after creating a child process that runs function
onandon(), sleeps for 14 seconds, then calls XINU's kill()
with the PID of the child process as argument. To verify that the
child process has been terminated, check the process table data structure
proctab. As in Problem 3.1, inspect the code where nulluser() resides
to determine how proctab is initialized and how to access it. 
Put this version of main() in main1.c under system/. The same goes
for onandon() in onandon.c.

<p>
Provide written answers to the above problems in Lab1Answers.pdf
and place it in system/.

<h2><b>Bonus problem</b> [15 pts]</h2>

<p>
Extend the capability of XINU's xsh (source contained in shell/) by
adding a new command of your own design.  Please add your new command
in a new file, lab1cmd.c in the shell/ directory.
Compile and test XINU with the
enhanced xsh. Indicate in Lab1Answers.pdf if you have done the Bonus Problem. 
Provide documentation of the added feature as comments inside the source code.
</p>

Note: The bonus problem provides an opportunity to earn extra credits that
count toward the lab component of the course. It is purely optional.
