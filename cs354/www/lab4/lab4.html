<h2>1. Objectives</h2>
<p>
In this lab, you will implement UNIX Solaris' TS scheduler in XINU. By using a
multilevel feedback control queue, you will achieve constant overhead process scheduling
independent of the number of processes in the system.
</p>

<hr width="100%">
<h2>2. Readings</h2>

<p>
  Read Chapters 6 and 7 of the XINU textbook.
</ul>

<h2>3. Implementation of UNIX Solaris TS scheduling</h2>

<h3> 3.1 Process classification for priority increase/decrease</h3>

<p>
Classification of processes based on their observed run-time behavior
must be done by the kernel efficiently so that the scheduler's footprint
is kept small. As discussed in class, a simple strategy used by UNIX Solaris
is to classify a process based on its most recent scheduling related
activity: (i) if a process consumed all of its time slice and needed to
be preempted by the clock interrupt handler then the process is viewed
as CPU-intensive; or (ii) a process voluntarily relinquishes the CPU
by making a blocking system call (e.g., sleepms()) in which case the
process is viewed as I/O-intensive. In both instances, the scheduler
will change the process' priority value. In case (i), the process
is demoted by reducing its priority; in (ii), the process's priority is
bumped up. 
</p>

<p>
After this change of priority, the scheduler picks a
highest priority process from ready processes
to run, round-robin if there are two or more
highest priority processes.
As to the time slice, in the case of (i), the quantum is increased to
reflect the CPU-intensive behavior of the process. In case (ii), the opposite
occurs.
The exact quantitative change in priority and quantum values is
determined by a system configuration file which contains calibrations to
suit a particular operating environment. The generic, default
configuration file is given by:
<ul>
<li>
Solaris UNIX dispatch table:
<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs354/disp-table-solaris.txt">
TS</a></li>
</ul>
Ignore columns 4 and 5 which are failsafe mechanisms to
prevent starvation if TS scheduling goes awry.
Use a data structure xts_tab defined in kernel header file xts_init.h that you
will create and place in include/
<pre>
struct xts_tab {
  int xts_quantum;       // new time slice
  int xts_tqexp;         // new priority: CPU-intensive (time quantum expired)
  int xts_slpret;        // new priority: I/O-intensive (sleep return)
};

extern struct xts_tab xts_conf[];
</pre>
which is read to initialize a kernel data structure,
struct xts_tab xts_conf[60],
in sysinit() in initialize.c. 
Since XINU does not have a file system, the content of the
Solaris dispatch must be hardcoded when xts_tab xts_conf[] is initialized.
Replace the constant "60"
using #define in xts_init.h. Choose your own name for the
constant definition. Note that in Solaris, the TS scheduling table
is exported as a configurable kernel data structure (requires superuser
status). Include xts_init.h in xinu.h.
</p>

<h3> 3.2 XINU kernel modification</h3>

<p>
Use the XINU kernel from lab3 with CPU usage monitoring code but without
fair scheduling modifications to implement UNIX Solaris TS scheduling. A
new data structure, xts_multifb, defined in xts_init.h is used to
achieve constant overhead TS scheduling
<pre>
struct xts_multifb {
  int status;             // binary flag: 0 if queue is empty, 1 otherwise
  qid16 queue_head;       // index to head of queue
  qid16 queue_tail;       // index to tail of queue
};

extern struct xts_multifb xts_ready[];
</pre>
where the size of the array xts_ready[] is the same as xts_conf[].
xts_ready[] of type struct xts_multifb replaces XINU's ready list to go from
linear scheduling overhead to constant overhead. Thus we will ignore XINU's
ready list but continue to use, struct qentry queuetab[NQENT], as the data
structure used to maintain queues in XINU. This XINU specific approach to
supporting queues works since a XINU process can only be in one queue (e.g.,
a process is ready or sleeping but not both).
</p>

<p>
Implement an internal kernel function, int xts_enqueue(pid32 pid, pri16 prio), in xts_enqueue.c
that enqueues the process given by pid and priority prio into the multilevel feedback queue
at the appropriate place. xts_enqueue() return 0 if successful, -1 otherwise.
Implement a function, pid32 xts_dequeue(void), in xts_dequeue.c 
that returns the process ID of a highest priority ready process
from xts_ready[]. If there are no ready processes outside of the kernel's NULL process, its
PID 0 is returned.
Implement a function, pri16 xts_priochk(void), in xts_priochk.c that returns the
highest priority of (ready) processes in xts_ready[]. xts_priochk() is used by the scheduler
resched() when determining if the current process should continue to run or not.
</p>

<p>
When making code changes to XINU, please follow the same guidelines as in lab3: clearly
indicate where in the source code changes are being made and for what purpose, DEBUG
printouts remain conditional.
</p>


<h3> 3.3 Performance evaluation</h3>

<p>
Carry out the same performance evaluation as in Problem 4.3 of lab3. Use the same benchmark
applications and calls to getcputot() to monitor CPU usage and gauge if your implementation of
UNIX Solaris TS scheduling in XINU is achieving "fair" sharing of CPU cycles. 
Discuss your findings in Lab4Answers.pdf. Describe in your write-up how you are handling
the NULL process under TS scheduling so that it is only executed if there are no other
ready processes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important: Before performing any kernel modification, please
back up the files (even intermediate files to guard against accidental
deletions) so that you can go back to a previous code base and recover
more easily from human errors in the development process.</b>
</p>

<h2><b>Bonus problem</b> (20 pts)</h2>

<p>
The 60 priority levels used in UNIX Solaris has proven to be effective
in real-world deployments, however, that is not to say that fewer
priority levels will not work (almost) equally well. As mentioned in
class, versions of BSD UNIX and Windows use significantly fewer priority
levels and are known to operate well. Modify the UNIX Solaris TS
implementation of Problem 3 so that priority levels are reduced from
60 to 20. The code should be the same except for reading 20 rows of
values instead of 60 and initializing xts_conf[] with different values.
Create a new calibration table that follows the same format as
<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs354/disp-table-solaris.txt">
TS</a> but has only 20 priority levels. Change the values of the entries
so that the TS scheduling approach we discussed (higher relative priority
to I/O-bound processes over CPU-bound processes, opposite for time slice)
is followed. Set the values as you see fit so as to achieve fair
sharing of CPU cycles. 
As in Problem 3, 
Benchmark the scheduler with the modified
scheduling calibration table on the "half-and-half"
test case only. Discuss your findings in Lab4Answers.pdf.
