<h1>
XINU Set-up
</h1>
</center>

<h2>
Objectives:
</h2>
The following instructions describe how to:
<ul>
<li>Log onto a XINU Lab workstation, download, extract, and compile a copy of the XINU source.</li>
<li>View the status of existing XINU backends.</li>
<li>Load a built XINU image onto a XINU backend and successfully boot the image.</li>
<li>Modify the XINU source code initialize.c which creates
the first XINU app process that executes function main() which
is located in system/main.c.</li>
</ul>

<hr width="100%">

<h2>1. XINU Configuration</h2>
To use XINU, several environment variables must be set. First log onto
one of the frontends <b>xinu01.cs.purdue.edu</b>, <b>xinu02.cs.purdue.edu,</b> ..., <b>xinu21.cs.purdue.edu</b> which are Linux 
PCs.
For remote login see Section 5. 
To login you should be able to use your career account username and password.  If you have any trouble with 
your account and its setup, please see the department help pages at <a 
href='http://www.cs.purdue.edu/help'>http://www.cs.purdue.edu/help</a>. If these pages do not address your particular problem, 
please use the trouble command from the command line to report the problem.

<p>The following assumes that your shell 
is bash. The syntax may vary slightly if you use a different shell.
(Run "echo $0" to determine your current shell.)
<p>Setting environment variables for XINU:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; 
Edit <b>.bashrc</b> in your home directory by adding /p/xinu/bin to your path, and setting the CS_CLASS environment variable:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>export PATH=${PATH}:/p/xinu/bin</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>export CS_CLASS=quark</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Run&nbsp; <b>source&nbsp; .bashrc</b> (or its equivalent) to
make the change take effect.
<p>Accessing and untarring XINU tarball source files:
<ol>
<li>
Change to your home directory, if you are not already in it.</li>
<br>
<li>Unpack:</li>
<pre>
tar zxvf /u/data/u3/cs354/xinu-spring2018.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>In your home directory, you will now have a directory called xinu-spring2018.
The subdirectories under this directory contain source code, header files,
configuration files, and Makefile for compiling XINU. 
</ol>

<hr width="100%">

<h2><b>2. Building XINU</b></h2>
To compile the XINU kernel which will be loaded and executed on a backend
machine, run "make" in the <b>compile/</b> directory:
<pre>
	% cd xinu-spring2018/compile
	% make
</pre>
This creates an executable file called <b>xinu</b>.

<br>
<br>

<hr width="100%">

<h2>3. Running XINU</h2>
The executable XINU binary runs on a selected backend machine. 
We have 95 dedicated backends: <b>galileo101.cs.purdue.edu</b>, ..., <b>galileo195.cs.purdue.edu</b>.
<p>The backends are all 
Intel Galileo
development boards which run a 
Quark system on chip processor.<p>
<p>
The backend machines are shared resources. When a backend machine is
grabbed by a student,
it is dedicated for use by that student to run his/her version of XINU.
To see which backends are available for booting XINU, type:
</p>

<pre><b>% cs-status -c quark</b></pre>

This will show you who is using each backend and how
long they have been using it. As with all hardware,
sometimes they fail and may become unavailable until repaired
by our technical staff.
<p>
To boot your copy of XINU on a backend, connect
to a back-end by issuing the command:

<pre><b>% cs-console [galileo1__]</b></pre>
With no arguments cs-console will connect you to the first available backend (including broken ones).

<p>
To load your copy of XINU onto a selected backend:
<pre><b>(control-@) </b>OR <b>(control-spacebar) </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//esc to local command-mode

<b>(command-mode) d</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//download command

<b>file: xinu </b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//tell it to download 'xinu' (this example assumes that you are in the xinu-spring2018/compile directory)

<b>(control-@)</b> OR <b>(control-spacebar)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//esc to local command-mode&nbsp;

<b>(command-mode) p</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//power cycle the backend
</pre>

You can download 'xinu' and power cycle the backend separately OR you can combine the two steps by using a single command:
<pre><b>(control-@) </b>OR <b>(control-spacebar) </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//esc to local command-mode

<b>(command-mode) g</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//tell cs-console to download the file 'xinu' AND power cycle the backend
</pre>

After several seconds, XINU should boot with a "Welcome to Xinu!" message that looks something like this:
<pre>

Hello World!

I'm the first XINU app and running function main() in system/main.c.
I was created by nulluser() in system/initialize.c using create().
My creator will turn itself into the do-nothing null process.
I will create a second XINU app that runs shell() in shell/shell.c as an example.
You can do something else, or do nothing; it's completely up to you.

<h2>4. Troubleshooting</h2>

<ol>
<li>We only show the mapping from bash to tcsh. If you use other shell types, please contact the TAs. The mapping is as follows:
Edit <b>.cshrc</b> instead of <b>.bashrc</b>. 
Add a line <b>setenv PATH ${PATH}:/p/xinu/bin</b> instead of <b>export PATH=${PATH}:/p/xinu/bin</b>. 
Run <b>tcsh</b> instead of <b>source .bashrc</b>.
<li>Try to figure out what's going on by yourself. Oftentimes the steps
described above were not precisely followed.
<li>When your XINU executable misbehaves or crashes 
(i.e., does not do what you intended
when programming the kernel) then debug the problem(s) and try again.
Since your version of the XINU kernel runs over dedicated hardware,
you are in full control. 
That is, there are no hidden side effects introduced by other
software layers that you are not privy to.  
By the same token, everything rests on your shoulders.
<li>If you get repeatedly stuck with "Booting XINU on ... " 
please contact the TAs.
<li>If you are not able to get a free backend, please contact the
TAs.
</ol>

<hr width="100%">

<h2>5. Remote Login</h2>
<p>
Use of the backends is limited to implementing, testing, and
evaluating lab assignments of CS 354. To access the backends, you don't
have to be physically present in the XINU lab but may remote login
using ssh to one of the lab's frontend machines. 
</p>

<hr width="100%">

<h2>6. An Example App: XINU Shell</h2>
<p>
By default, when XINU boots up, it runs a shell (xsh).  To view all the
usable shell commands, run the help command:
</p>
<pre>
	xsh $ help

	shell commands are:

	argecho      date         exit         led          ping         udpecho
	arp          devdump      help         memdump      ps           udpeserver
	cat          echo         ipaddr       memstat      sleep        uptime
	clear        ethstat      kill         nvram        udpdump      ?
</pre>
<p>
Take a moment to run some shell commands and view their output.  
Specifically make sure you run the ps command which lists 
information about running processes.
</p>
<pre>
	xsh $ ps
	Pid Name             State Prio Ppid Stack Base Stack Ptr  Stack Size
	--- ---------------- ----- ---- ---- ---------- ---------- ----------
	  0 prnull           ready    0    0 0x0EFDEFFC 0x0EFDEEC0     8192
	  1 rdsproc          wait   200    0 0x0EFDCFFC 0x0EFDCAAC    16384
	  2 Main process     recv    20    0 0x0EFD8FFC 0x0EFD8F64    65536
	  3 shell            recv    50    2 0x0EFC8FFC 0x0EFC8C6C     8192
	  4 ps               curr    20    3 0x0EFC6FFC 0x0EFC6E18     8192
</pre>
<p>
Here you can see the several pieces of information for all processes 
currently running.  The name gives some detail about what the process 
is intended for.  XINU always contains a special process with process 
identifier (pid) 0 called the null process (or prnull).  This process 
is the first process created by XINU and is always ready to execute.  
Unlike other processes, prnull is handcrafted without using create().
The inclusion of this process ensures that there is always something 
for XINU to execute even if all other processes have finished or are 
waiting for something. By default, UNIX/Linux and Windows have similar
null or idle processes.
