<h2>1. Objectives</h2>

<p>
The objective of this lab is to enhance XINU's kernel services so that
blocking IPC in the form of 1-word message blocked transmission and asynchronous
IPC using callback function are added.

<h2>2. Readings</h2>

<p>

<h2>3. Blocking message send [130 pts]</h2>

<p>
This problem concerns the implementation
of a blocking version of send(), call it sendblk(). 
sendblk() follows the same function definition as send().
If the receiver's 1-word message buffer is empty, sendblk() behaves
like send(). If the receiver's buffer is full, sendblk()
blocks indefinitely. Upon blocking,
XINU's upper half context switches out the sending process 
and puts it into a waiting state SNDBLK. This is implemented
by defining an additional constant PR_SNDBLK
in process.h with value 20. The 1-word message
is stored in the sending process's
process table entry where three new fields are defined:
<pre>
   bool8 sendblkflag;            /* Nonzero iff blocking to send */
   umsg32 sendblkmsg;            /* Message attempting to send */
   pid32 sendblkrcp;             /* PID of recipient */
</pre>
sendblkflag is nonzero if sendblkmsg is valid, 
sendblkmsg holds the 1-word message to be sent, 
and sendblkrcp is the PID of the receiver process.
</p>

<p>
We introduce two additional fields in the process table structure procent
<pre>
   bool8 rcpblkflag;            /* Nonzero iff one or more process are waiting to send */
   qid16 sendqueue;             /* Index to FIFO queue of blocked senders */
</pre>
where rcpblkflag indicates whether there are blocked sending processes and sendqueue is
an index to the FIFO queue of blocked sending processes.
A blocking sender process is put on the per-receiver FIFO waiting queue pointed to
by sendqueue.
At the receiver end, before a receiving process returns from
receive() it must check if there are any blocked sending processes.
If there are, unblock the first process in the FIFO sendqueue which includes
copying the message from the sender's message buffer sendblkmsg to the receiver's
buffer prmsg and setting the appropriate flags.
</p>

<p>
Implement sendblk() using the fixed priority scheduler of XINU.
Create test cases whose output 
demonstrate the correct functioning
of the blocking message send extension of kernel services. 
Include in your test cases sluggish receivers
that sleep so that its FIFO sender queue builds up.
In Lab5Answers.pdf describe how you set up your test
cases and how your verified correctness of your implementation.
send() must work as is without being impacted by sendblk().
Although there is no need to implement, describe what you think should
happen if a receiver process terminates when one or more processes
are blocked in its sendqueue. Explain the rationale behind your design
decision. As in previous labs, please save each C function in a separate
file following the function name (e.g., sendblk.c for sendblk()) and
place them in system/.

<h2>4. Asynchronous IPC with callback function</b> (200 pts)</h2>
<p>
This problem concerns implementation of asynchronous IPC with
callback function in XINU as discussed in class. A process registers
a user callback function with the kernel requesting that it be
executed on behalf of the process when a 1-word message arrives.
The callback function contains code written by the an app programmer.
Although XINU does not implement isolation/protection, we will
adopt a design suitable for modern operating systems such as
Linux/UNIX and Windows that must ensure that isolation/protection
is preserved when a kernel provides this service.
</p>

<p>
When a 1-word message is sent to the receiver process that registered
a callback function -- in our uni-processor backends this
implies that the sender process is the current process running on
the CPU -- XINU will not run the callback function as kernel. That is,
as part of upper or lower half code
running in kernel mode in Linux/UNIX and Windows (in XINU everything runs
in kernel mode).
Nor will XINU borrow the sender process's context to run the callback function
since processes must be shielded from each other.
Instead, the kernel waits until its scheduler context-switches in
the receiver process. Before resuming the receiver process's
execution where it left off, XINU will inject a jump to the registered
callback function so that the callback function is executed in the
context of the process that registered it. After the callback
function returns, the receiver process resumes where it originally
left off. Thus the receiver process's app code does not call the
callback function directly. Beyond initially registering the
callback function, the user process has no involvement in the
eventual scheduling and execution of the callback function.
Instead the kernel, in our case XINU, sets up the function call 
at run-time prompted by a message send event.
</p>

<p>
The kernel exports a system call, cbreg(), that
is used by an application to specify 
a user space callback function to be
executed in its context when a message is successfully received. 
By "successfully" we mean that the receiver process's message buffer
was empty so that the message could be saved. Otherwise,
message transmission was unsuccessful and the callback function is
not invoked.
The function definition is given by
<ul>
<li>
syscall cbreg( int (* fnp) (void) )
</li>
</ul>
where fnp is a function pointer to a user space callback function.
For simplicity, a callback function returns a value of type int32 and takes
no argument.
What the callback function does is up to the app programmer. An example
callback function is
<pre>
   int32 mrecv_cb(void) {
   extern umsg32 mbuf;

      mbuf = receive();
      return(OK);
   }
</pre>
where mbuf is a global variable in the receiver process's memory
space to which the received message is copied. Hence it is the responsibility
of the callback function to copy the message from kernel buffer to user buffer.
Note that although receive() is a blocking system call, it will not block since
mrecv_cb() will be invoked
only after a message has been received.
A XINU process (e.g., the process running main()) 
registers a callback function using
<pre>
   if (cbreg(&mrecv_cb) != OK) {
      kprintf("cb registration failed!");
      return 1;
   }
</pre>
</p>
<p>
XINU remembers that a callback function has been registered by introducing two new
fields in the process table structure procent:
<pre>
   bool8 prhascb;          /* Nonzero iff callback function has been registered */
   int (* fptr) ();        /* Pointer to cb function if one has been registered */
</pre>
prhascb is a Boolean flag and fptr is NULL if no callback function has been registered.
When a process tries to register a second callback function, cbreg() should return
with an error.
</p>

<p>
To implement asynchronous IPC in XINU whose
design is compatible with kernels that support isolation/protection,
XINU runs the receiver's
callback function in the context of receiver process when 
it is scheduled next.
Use a XINU version that uses the fixed priority scheduler as in Problem 3.
Describe your design that allows XINU to implement 
asynchronous IPC with callback function in Lab5Answers.pdf. 
Discuss why your design is compatible with kernels that support isolation/protection
even though it is implemented in XINU.
Test your design and implementation using sender and receiver processes.
This includes sending of multiple messages by a single sender and multiple
sender processes. Use kprintf() to track the relevant events to help
establish correctness.
Save new functions in separate files under system/ following our naming convention.

<h2>Bonus problem [20 pts]</h2>

<p>
Using the man pages of Linux msgsnd() and msgrcv() as reference examples, write man
pages for receive() and sendblk() as plain ASCII text files 
(man pages follow the troff typesetting format) receive.2 and sendblk.2 in
system/. Make the man pages as unambiguous and complete as feasible.
