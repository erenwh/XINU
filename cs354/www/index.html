Ability to understand and write
complex programs in C. Familiarity with

    <h2>Grading Policy:</h2>

    <p>
The grade will be determined by a midterm, final, and lab assignments. 
Their relative weights are:</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="0">
      <tr>
        <td>
          Midterm
        </td>
        <td>
          25%
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Final
        </td>
        <td>
          30%
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Lab/HW assignments
        </td>
        <td>
          45%
        </td>
      </tr>

    </table>

<p>
The exams and lab assignments will have bonus problems. Bonus points are
confined to each component (midterm, final, lab). For example, bonus points
from the midterm help achieve the 25% contribution of the midterm but do
not carry over to the final or lab components.
</p>


    <h2>Labs and Policies:</h2>
    <p>We will use the XINU operating
    system for the lab assignments. The XINU lab is located in the
    HAAS Building Room 257.
The lab houses dedicated backend machines used for implementation,
testing, and performance evaluation. They include Intel x86-compatible
Galileo boards equipped with Quark X1000 processors. 
We will use x86 backends and frontends as our implementation 
platform.
</p>

    <h3>Getting your CS account.</h3>
    <p>
    Students registered in the course should have an account
automatically set up. Please check by going to HAAS 257 and logging 
in to one of the frontend machines (Linux PCs). If you have registered 
up but don't have an account, please contact <a href=
    "mailto:accounts@cs.purdue.edu">sciencehelp@purdue.edu</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Late Policy</h3>

    <p>
To help manage unexpected scheduling demands, you are
given a budget of 3 late days in total that may be used for 
late submissions of lab/homework assignments.
For example, you may submit 1 day late on three lab assignments,
or 3 days late on one lab assignment. Any combination is valid
as long as the total days delayed does not exceed 3.
There will be a total of 6 lab assignments.
Late days not utilized at the end of the semester will be
converted to 25 bonus points each (maximum of 75).
</p>
    <p>
Due to the low-level systems nature of the lab assignments,
coding and evaluating parts of an operating system running on 
hardware is time intensive. To encourage
proactive handling of assignments, all submissions turned in
2 days prior to its deadline will be given a 7% bonus credit
(as a fraction of the points received).
</p>

    <h3>Academic Dishonesty</h3>

    <p>We wish to foster an open and
    collegial class environment. At the same time, we are
    <em>vigorously</em> opposed to academic
    dishonesty because it seriously detracts from the education of
    honest students. Because of this, we have the following
    standard policy on academic honesty, consistent with Purdue
    University's official policy.</p>
    <p>
    All CS354 lab assignments are <em>individual</em> efforts and collaboration
    is not allowed.
    It is permissible to discuss
    general ideas with other students, or to make
    use of reference materials in the library or online. If you do
    this, you will be expected to clearly disclose with whom you
    discussed the ideas, or to cite the references
    used. Failure to do so will be considered cheating or
    plagiarism. Collaboration that entails discussing specific
    methods of solution is not allowed. This
    includes discussing and sharing
    of code. </p>

    <p>Unless otherwise explicitly
    specified, all code that is submitted is to be entirely each
    student&rsquo;s own work. Using any code or copying any
    assignment from others is strictly prohibited without advance
    prior permission from the instructor. This includes the use of
    code others have submitted in the past.</p>

    <p>
    Students who share their work with others are <i>as</i>
    responsible for academic dishonesty as the student receiving
    the material. Students are not to show work to other students,
    in class or otherwise. Students are responsible for the security
    of their work and should ensure that printed copies are not
    left in accessible places, and that file/directory permissions
    are set to be <em>unreadable</em> to
    others (e.g. use "chmod -R 700 *"
    from your home directory). If you need assistance protecting
    your work, please contact the TAs or the instructor.</p>

    <p>Students who encourage others
    to cheat or plagiarize, or students who are aware of plagiarism
    or cheating and do not report it are also participating in
    academically dishonest behavior.</p>

    <p>Be aware that we will use a
    software tool called <a href=
    "http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">MOSS</a> to check
    for copying among submitted assignments. Additionally, the
    instructor and TA will be inspecting all submitted material to
    ensure honesty.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <h3>Any case of academic dishonesty will be
      dealt with by a severe grade penalty in the overall class
      grade and referral to the Office of the Dean of
      Students.</h3>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Campus Emergencies:</h2>

    <p>In the event of a major campus
    emergency, course requirements, deadlines, and grading
    percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by
    a revised semester calendar. If such unusual circumstances
    arise, students may determine any such changes by contacting
    their instructors via email or phone, and checking the course
    web page for updates.</p>

    <p>Emergencies and campus
    closings will be announced on local media and on the main
    Purdue University WWW site <a href="http://www.purdue.edu"
    title="Main Purdue WWW site">http://www.purdue.edu</a>.
    Individuals may <a href="http://news.uns.purdue.edu/mail.html"

    text</a> announcement service. Other details are on the

    <h2>Course Content:</h2>

<p>
This is an undergraduate introductory course to operating systems that
investigates how modern operating systems are architected and implemented. 
Extensive implementation experience is gained by coding, testing,
and benchmarking key components of the XINU operating system on
dedicated backend hardware. Our main implementation platform will be
x86-compatible backend machines and Intel x86 frontend PCs where
code is developed.
Most coding is done in C, with some hardware
dependent components utilizing assembly language.
</p>

<p>The topics covered in the course include: evolution of computing
systems and their operating systems, process management, inter-process
communication, memory manangement,
virtual memory, I/O subsystems and device management, file systems,
virtualization and security, and mobile operating systems. 
In addition to implementing key OS features in XINU,
we will examine case studies in Linux, UNIX (Solaris and BSD), 
and Windows that differ from XINU and each other in significant ways.
One important example is how I/O subsystems are architected
to handle a range of heterogenous devices and their interrupts, including
high-speed USB and wired/wireless network interfaces, that characterize
many of today's computing systems.
Kernel dependence on changing hardware features and support is
an important theme throughout the course that will help familiarize with
recent developments such as non-traditional file systems for flash
memory prevalent in mobile systems.
We will touch upon mobile OS (e.g., iOS, Android) with emphasis on
differences with desktop/server operating systems.
